# Matrix_multiplication_c
This is a C program that performs matrix multiplication. Here's a brief overview:

- The program prompts the user to input the dimensions of two matrices (row1, col1, row2, col2).
- It checks if matrix multiplication is possible (i.e., col1 == row2).
- If possible, it dynamically allocates memory for the two matrices (m1 and m2) and the resultant matrix (rm).
- The user is then prompted to input the elements of both matrices.
- The program performs matrix multiplication and stores the result in the resultant matrix (rm).
- Finally, it prints the resultant matrix and frees the dynamically allocated memory.

Note that this program uses dynamic memory allocation to handle matrices of varying sizes. It also checks for the possibility of matrix multiplication before proceeding. The program can be enhanced by adding error handling and more advanced matrixÂ operations.
